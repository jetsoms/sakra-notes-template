# Reference a date

You can reference a date in a note using the following syntax:

```markdown
[[YYYY-MM-DD]]
```

This will create a link to all notes that also reference that date.

## Example

```markdown
[[2023-07-11]]
```

[[2023-07-11]]

## Pro tip

Lumen will autocomplete relative dates for you. For example, if you type `[[today]]` and press `Enter`, it will be replaced with the current date. This works for almost any relative date you can think of, including `[[yesterday]]`, `[[last week]]`, `[[in 4 days]]`, etc. Try it out!
