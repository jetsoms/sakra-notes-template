# Link to another note

You can link to another note using the following syntax:

```markdown
[[<note-id>|<link-text>]]
```

- `note-id` is the name of another markdown file (without the `.md` extension).
- `link-text` is optional text to display in the link. If you omit it, the `note-id` will be used as the link text.


## Example

```markdown
[[1689836787028|Getting started]]
```

[[1689836787028|Getting started]]
